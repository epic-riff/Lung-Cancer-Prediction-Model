# Lung-Cancer-Prediction-Model
This project contains a computer vision model that looks at lung scans and predicts whether the person has lung cancer.

The model file was too large to add in the repository, so if you want to view the file, you can view the code above. The code has comments that explains the code for a more in depth description.
